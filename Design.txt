make trees look actually good - diff color base & random color leaves
	just use cubes instead of models probs better
figure out a way to do skyboxes - just more clutter around the edges and impassable walls?
	use pixel art of trees or smth for *visible* wall
coins scattered throughout levels that are used to upgrade equips
	equips can be upgraded to buff stats
/launchpad that you can throw down that launches you in the air like a mega jump
/equip that shoots a zipline then you ride it - looks like harpoon launcher with hook at the end instead of spear
/	lasts a little while and you can ride it both ways for a little while
come up with more tool ideas

short animation to show weapon has reloaded - quick whip to the side or smth

c4 model
c4 explosion particles
coin pickup particles based on coin type

boat/ferry parkour level

hub world
	physical/diegetic ui for upgrades/etc
		+/- button or up/down arrows & bars in between light up to indicate tool level
	contains portals to each level - have to parkour to get to each one

remove coin multiplier - just count normally
	can still have meter for chain coin collecting for end of level achievements
		get extra coins for achievements during level
			collect coins before meter goes down, collect all coins, etc
	collect x% of coins to spawn exit portal? spawn exit portal at spawn loc?
