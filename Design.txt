implement train area models - give them physics
make trees look actually good - diff color base & random color leaves
	just use cubes instead of models probs better
figure out a way to do skyboxes - just more clutter around the edges and impassable walls?
fix deltatime not working without vsync
coins scattered throughout levels that are used to upgrade equips
	equips have levels that buff stats
a hookblade equip would be mega cool - we just need to figure out how it works XD
	click sends you flying perpendicular & a bit up from the normal of the clicked surface
		indicator to tell if you're in range - short/no cooldown but range is small
	model is zipline handle style object with 3 arrows
launchpad that you can throw down that launches you in the air like a mega jump
equip that shoots a zipline then you ride it - looks like harpoon launcher

short animation to show weapon has reloaded - quick whip to the side or smth
