implement train area models - give them physics
make trees look actually good - diff color base & random color leaves
	just use cubes instead of models probs better
figure out a way to do skyboxes - just more clutter around the edges and impassable walls?
	use pixel art of trees or smth for *visible* wall
coins scattered throughout levels that are used to upgrade equips
	equips have levels that buff stats
launchpad that you can throw down that launches you in the air like a mega jump
equip that shoots a zipline then you ride it - looks like harpoon launcher with hook at the end instead of spear
	lasts a little while and you can ride it both ways for a little while

short animation to show weapon has reloaded - quick whip to the side or smth

c4 model
c4 explosion particles

boat/ferry parkour level
